In this problem, you have to add and multiply huge numbers! These numbers are so big that you can't contain them in any ordinary data types like a long integer.

Use the power of Java's BigInteger class and solve this problem.

**Input Format**

There will be two lines containing two numbers, **_a_** and **_b_**.

**Constraints**

**_a_** and **_b_** are non-negative integers and can have maximum **200** digits.

**Output Format**

Output two lines. The first line should contain **_a_** + **_b_**, and the second line should contain **_a_** × **_b_**. Don't print any leading zeros.

**Sample Input**

```
1234
20
```

**Sample Output**

```
1254
24680
```

**Explanation**

**1234** + **20** = **1254**

**1234** × **20** = **24680**
